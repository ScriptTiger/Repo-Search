# Repo Search
Tool to instantly search all or specific files in any repo for keywords or phrases natively on Windows extremely easily, with an option to output results to a file.

This script is nice for programmers trying to find all the references to something quickly. If you're a gamer, however, and play any open-source games, this script is even nicer when used to transform the source code of your open source game into a complete offline knowledgebase or even Easter egg hunting engine.

You can easily make a shortcut to search a specific repo with one click by sending the root and files to search as parameters in a short one-line script:  
    @search.cmd "c:\blah\blah\myrepo" "*.txt *.c *.h"
